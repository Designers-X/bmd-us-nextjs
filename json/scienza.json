            "Phytosome technology is biomimicry. Our bodies have evolved to view beneficialplant-based polyphenols as useless or dangerous. For this reason, nutrients like curcumin are blocked by your gut before they can enter your bloodstream. No matter how much curcumin you take, the benefits are limited without Phytosome technology. Phytosome uses biomimicry to wrap polyphenols in a fatty lipid, like a delivery truck. With the curcumin molecule hidden inside, the lipid can pass through the gut and into your bloodstream with 3000% more bioavailability. Phytosome sets the new standard in prescription-grade natural ingredients."
